## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#Vaya shyam  

I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building scalable web applications and APIs using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Python. 
During my B.Tech in Computer Engineering (CGPA: 8.22), I interned at eInfochips, where I delivered user-friendly web solutions and optimized backend functionality.

My projects include:
- Developing a RESTful Weather API from scratch in Node.js.
- Creating a highly responsive Password Generator in React.js with Tailwind CSS.

I am proficient in JavaScript (ES6+), Python, MongoDB, MySQL, RESTful APIs, and testing with Postman. I thrive in collaborative environments, bringing strong problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and a drive to turn ideas into impactful digital solutions.

I am eager to contribute to innovative teams and take on challenging full stack or backend roles. Letâ€™s connect!
